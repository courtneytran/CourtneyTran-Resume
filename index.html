        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychologistüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Courtney Tran. I am 18 years old. When I was still in high school, I attended The TGR Learning Lab located in Anaheim, California. At this program, I took a course called ‚ÄúMindcraft.‚Äù It was a course about the human brain. I was fascinated by the human brain and I enjoyed the course. During my time there I learned interesting facts like how there is a left and right hemisphere of the brain. Something that caught my interest while taking the course was the dissection of a sheep‚Äôs brain. While taking this course I decided to pursue my career in majoring in Psychology. I hope to become a psychologist. My interest in the human brain has helped me understand other people and myself, however, I still have a plethora of things to learn about the human brain. <br><br>

       Some hobbies of mine are tennis, photography, and drawing. I have played tennis for six years from middle school to high school in a team. The game of tennis may seem easy, but it is not, there are many rules to follow. When I am on the tennis court, I have to have a strategy because in a game of tennis, if you predict where your ball will land then it is likely that you have control of the game. In addition, another hobby of mine is photography. I enjoy capturing moments where people are having the time of their lives hanging out with friends or either enjoying life to the fullest. For one of my high school clubs, I was a historian for about a year. I attended several events where I volunteered and helped others in need. While I was doing all that, I was doing my best to try to capture photos for the club. Moreover, I was part of the club division‚Äôs Media Team. This was when I would take pictures of the club members from all over the Anaheim Union District. It was a very interesting task for me to do because I had to take photos of other members of the club who were from different high schools. It was a learning experience for me as well since I am an introverted person. This was the time for me to practice my communication and photography skills.<br><br>

       Lastly, my other hobby is arts and crafts. Ever since I was little I have always enjoyed creating or drawing things, it made me feel good about my skills because it was a way to express my creativity. I am fond of making origami lucky stars. The work is tedious, but it is relaxing and calm to work on a mini-project while watching ‚ÄúGilmore Girls.‚Äù My ability to multitask has helped me work with multiple projects at a time. My work ethics are disciplined, responsible, and accountable. Having these work ethics has helped me finish my projects at a reasonable time or by the due date. Although I multitask several projects/assignments I have to get my work done.
